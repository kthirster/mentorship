	<h2> Starting from the scratch (Web Dev) </h2>
	<p>So, there was a time that i learnt HTML, i actually learnt a lot in the past but i cant really <em>explain </em> how it all in fragments now. it's all good anyway. </p>

	<p> HTML in my opinion is a <i>primary language</i> of the web, just like you have to learn the basics of every language to be able to pass a meaningful <u>message</u>, it is important to learn HTML for web dev.</p>

	<p> I am going to trying to put the little things i have learnt this past days into writing </p>
	<h4> At the moment, there are 3 languages to be familiar with in the field of Web Dev. </h4>
	<ul>
		<li> HTML: It is the primary language of the web. Most browsers understand this language</li>
		<li> CSS: This is concern with the layout, design of a webpage, I actually think HTML can do some of this things but for simplicity and flexibity it;s better to use CSS </li>
		<li> Javascript: Havent really study this, it's for interactivity on the webpage</li>

			</ul>
			<p> I actually dont think one need to cram all the attributes and element there is, there is a reference. Just have an idea of what you want to do, then get the right tag for it </p>
			<p> So, moving to <strong> Colors </strong></p>
			<p style="color:blue"> My Favourite Color is Blue </p>
